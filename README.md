# MDPG

Password generator based on crypto_scrypt by Colin Percival.
The idea of the program is to generate complex passwords when they are needed, not to remember or store them. It is enough to remember one main password.

Note: I'm not a security expert. I cannot assess the reliability of this method. This program is an analogue of other programs based on crypto_scrypt.

Install

Change the current working directory to ".../src". Do "make" to compile the program. Do "make install" to install the program. 
Do "make uninstall" to uninstall the program.

This method is not suitable for all systems. I recommend looking at the actions in the Makefile.
